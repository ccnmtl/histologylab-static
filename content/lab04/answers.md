<h2>#6 External Ear (Elastin Stain)</h2>

<p>Where else does elastic cartilage occur in the body? <i>Eustachian tube and epiglottis.</i></p>

<p><b><span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span></b></p>

<p>1.  What are the mechanisms of cartilage growth?  <i>Appositional and interstitial growth</i></p>

<p>2.  What is the distribution of blood vessels in cartilage, and how does this relate to the nutrition of cartilage? <i>Blood vessels are found only in the perichondrium. Nutrition by diffusion through ground substance</i></p>

<h2>#11 Rib, Cross Section. (H &amp; E) </h2>

<p>The <u>cementing lines</u> that delimit the Haversian systems may appear refractile or slightly basophilic. What accounts for this basophilia?  <i>Proteoglycans.</i></p>

<p><b><span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span></b></p>

<p>1.  What structures are found within Haversian canals? <i>Capillaries and nerves</i><br>
2.  Is the osseous lamella adjacent to the Haversian canal the youngest or the oldest lamella of a particular osteon? <i>The youngest</i></p>

<p>Be sure you know how cartilage and bone differ morphologically, functionally, and with respect to blood supply.</p>




<h2>#97 Finger, human, 2 mos.  (H&amp;E) </h2>

<p>What structure in mature bone is created by the zone of resportion? <i>The marrow canal</i></p>

<p><b><span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span></b></p>

<p>1. What are the differences between intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification?  <br>
<i>Intramembranous ossification: does not use a cartilage framework, bone develops directly on or within mesenchyme. Bone growth is appositional.  Found in irregular bones such as the bones of the skull.<br>
Endochondral ossification: replaces a preexisting cartilage framework. The bone lengthens through interstitial growth and changes diameter through appositional growth. Found in long bones</i></p>
