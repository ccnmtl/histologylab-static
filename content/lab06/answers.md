<h2>Skeletal Muscile</h2>

<h3>#3 Muscle and tendon junction, <span class="caps">H&amp;E </span></h3>

<p>Define a sarcomere.  Be sure you know what the electron microscope has revealed about its fine structure.  Know the structural changes that occur in a sarcomere during contraction and the theory that has evolved from electron microscopic studies to explain muscle contraction. <em>A sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of a muscle cell, repeating sarcomeres comprise a myofibril.  The Z-bands are considered the ends of a single sarcomere, with the H-band in the center.  As the muscle contracts, the Z-bands move closer together and the I-band and H-band shorten in length as the actin thin filaments are moved along the myosin thick filaments.  The A band remains the same length because the length of the myosin unit does not change.</em></p>

<h2>Cardiac Muscle </h2>

<h3>#17 Heart, (Mallory-Azan)</h3>

<p>What is the position of the nuclei? <em>Central.</em>  Do the myofibrils pass through intercalated discs?   <em>No.</em> How can you distinguish cross sections of cardiac muscle fibers from those of skeletal muscle fibers? <em>Central nuclei, intercalated discs, branching fibers</em></p>

<h2>Smooth Muscle</h2>

<h3><span class="caps">OPTIONAL</span>:  #102 Small intestine (Bodian/silver)</h3>

<p>Note that when the muscle cells are cut in cross section, there are interruptions in the basal laminae.  What is responsible for these discontinuities? <em>Gap junctions</em></p>

<h3><span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span></h3>


<ol>
<li>Why do smooth muscle fibers in cross section have different diameters and why do some of these fail to show nuclei? <em>Smooth muscle cells have tapered ends.  Since the cells interdigitate different diameters would be revealed in a particular plane of section and the plane of section does not always go through the nucleus.</em></li>
<li>Are myofibrils or sarcomeres present in smooth muscle fibers? <em>No</em> </li>
</ol>
