<h2>Skeletal Muscile</h2>

<h3>#3 Muscle and tendon junction, <span class="caps">H&amp;E </span></h3>

<p>Define a sarcomere.  Be sure you know what the electron microscope has revealed about its fine structure.  Know the structural changes that occur in a sarcomere during contraction and the theory that has evolved from electron microscopic studies to explain muscle contraction.</p>

<h2>Cardiac Muscle </h2>

<h3>#17 Heart, (Mallory-Azan)</h3>

<p>What is the position of the nuclei? <br>
Do the myofibrils pass through intercalated discs?<br>
How can you distinguish cross sections of cardiac muscle fibers from those of skeletal muscle fibers? </p>

<h2>Smooth Muscle</h2>

<h3><span class="caps">OPTIONAL</span>:  #102 Small intestine (Bodian/silver)</h3>

<p>Note that when the muscle cells are cut in cross section, there are interruptions in the basal laminae.  What is responsible for these discontinuities? </p>

<h3><span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span></h3>

<ol>
<li> Why do smooth muscle fibers in cross section have different diameters and why do some of these fail to show nuclei?</li>
<li> Are myofibrils or sarcomeres present in smooth muscle fibers? </li>
</ol>
