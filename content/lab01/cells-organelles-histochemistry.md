						<h3>#101 Small Intestine Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and hematoxylin</h3>

<p><u>Carbohydrates</u>, e.g., glycogen, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, are demonstrated by this histochemical reaction  (see description <span class="caps">PAS </span>on p. 97 and in textbooks).  Their presence is indicated by a red reaction product.  Such structures are termed <span class="caps">PAS </span>positive.  Note the intense reaction at the apical surface of the epithelial cells and within scattered goblet cells (containing mucin) at the luminal surface.  Nuclei are stained blue because the section was counterstained with hematoxylin.  </p>
