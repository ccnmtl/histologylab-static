						<p>Mitosis is divided into four distinct stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During <u>prophase</u>, the nuclear envelope disperses, replicated chromosomes condense, and the two sister chromatids become attached at a site called the centromere. At <u>metaphase</u>, duplicated chromosomes become aligned in a single plane. At <u>anaphase A</u>, the sister chromatids separate and begin to migrate to the poles.  At <u>anaphase B</u>, the sister chromatids continue to migrate toward the poles and the microtubules of the spindle elongate.  During <u>telophase</u>, the sister chromatids reach the poles, the nuclear envelope re-forms and the chromosomes decondense.  Cytoplasmic division usually begins in anaphase and is complete by the end of telophase.   </p>

<h3>Slide #112: Whitefish Mitosis</h3>

<p>The whitefish embryo has been stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E).  Cells are dividing mitotically.  Moreover, since cells are dividing asynchronously, there are examples of cells at all stages of the cell cycle.  Assess <u>nuclear envelope breakdown</u>, <u>chromosome condensation</u>, <u>mitotic spindle development</u>, and location of <u>condensed chromosomes</u> in the whitefish mitotic cells.  On the basis of these parameters, identify and determine the distinguishing features of cells in <u>prophase</u>, <u>metaphase</u>, <u>anaphase</u> (A and B) and <u>telophase</u>. </p>
