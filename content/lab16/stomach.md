						<p>The stomach extends from the esophagus to the duodenum; it is divisible into the <u>cardiac, fundus, body,</u> and <u>pyloric regions</u>.  The distensible stomach is involved in both the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, and also serves as a temporary reservoir. Its simple columnar epithelium is specialized for secretion.  The gastric mucosa contains <u>gastric pits</u> (foveolae), which are surface invaginations that also serve as the ducts of the underlying intrinsic <u>gastric glands</u>.  Three basic cell types contribute to the secretion of gastric juice, and each has a characteristic appearance under the light and electron microscope.  All of these cell types can be seen in the fundus and body of the stomach.</p>


<ol>
<li><img src="/assets/images/Stomach%201%20mucus%20secreting%20cells.jpg" style="width:129px; height:130px; float:right;"><u>Mucus-secreting cells</u>.  These cells form the surface epithelium and extend inward to line the gastric pits.  Nuclei are basal, and the supranuclear cytoplasm containing <u>mucinogen granules</u> appears clear or vacuolated with H &amp; E stain. <u>Mucous neck cells</u> occur in the junctional region of the gastric pits and glands, and it is in this region that cell proliferation for the renewal of the epithelium occurs.</li>
<li><img src="/assets/images/Stomach%202%20parietal%20cells.jpg" style="width:85px; height:140px; float:right;"><u>Parietal cells</u>.  These pyramidal or spherical cells appear wedged in between other cells of the gastric glands. They are characterized by their finely granular <u>acidophilic</u> cytoplasm due to an abundance of mitochondria, and by their central, spherical nucleus. They contain an extensive intracellular canalicular system that communicates with the lumen of the gland (visible at the EM level). These cells are involved in the elaboration of <u>hydrochloric acid</u> and <u>intrinsic factor</u>. </li>

<li><img src="/assets/images/Stomach%203%20cheif%20cells.jpg" style="width:181px; height:140px; float:right;"><u>Chief (zymogen) cells</u>.  These cells are involved in the secretion of enzymes, particularly the proteolytic enzyme <u>pepsinogen</u> (pepsin in the active state).  As is characteristic of cells involved in protein synthesis and secretion, these cells contain <u>basophilic</u> cytoplasm, particularly at their base due to the extensive development of <u>rough endoplasmic reticulum</u>.  Although at the LM level the supranuclear cytoplasm generally appears clear or vacuolated, electron micrographs reveal an accumulation of membrane-bound <u>secretory granules</u> in this region.</li>

<h3><u>#34 Stomach, Body, (H&amp;E)</u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/34%20stomach%20-%20auerbachs%20plexus.jpg" style="width:296px; height:130px; float:right;">Identify the <u>mucosa</u>, <u>submucosa</u>, and <u>muscularis externa</u>.  Locate the following elements of the mucosa: the <u>luminal surface</u> mucous secreting cells, the <u>gastric pits</u> and the cells lining them.  <u>Parietal cells</u> are particularly prominent and <u>chief cells</u> and <u>mucous neck cells</u> are present.  Note the loose connective tissue surrounding the gastric pits, the muscularis mucosae, which forms a boundary between the mucosa and submucosa, and the blood vessels in the submucosa. The cell bodies and nerve fibers of the Meissner's plexus are found in the submucosa. These are not clearly visible on this slide. Examine the muscularis externa and notice that the smooth muscle is oriented in several different planes. A serosa covers the external surface of the gland in this section. The <u>myenteric plexus (Auerbach's plexus)</u> is located between the external and adjacent inner layers of smooth muscle and is clearly evident on this slide.</p>
