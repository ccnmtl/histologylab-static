						<h3><u>#39 Colon, thin plastic section (H&amp;E)</u></h3>

<p>Note the regularity of the intestinal mucosa crypts and the lack of villi. Also note the abundance of goblet cells. These features are diagnostic. This is a good slide in which to review the structure of arteries, veins, and the peripheral autonomic plexus.  Enteroendocrine cells are present at the base of the crypts, but are difficult to identify. These cells secrete hormones through the basal cell surface into the capillaries.</p>

<h3><u>#48 Rectum and Anal Canal. (H&amp;E)</u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/48%20rectum%20and%20anal%20canal.jpg" style="width:161px; height:150px; float:right;">The rectum is histologically similar to the colon. There is an abrupt transition between the rectal simple columnar epithelium and the stratified epithelium of the anal canal.  The anal epithelium may appear stratified cuboidal at the junction with the rectum, but it assumes a typical <u>stratified squamous</u> appearance more distally.  The intestinal glands end abruptly at the recto-anal junction.  The inner circular layer of the muscularis externa is thickened considerably to form the <u>internal anal sphincter</u>.  The submucosa of the anal canal is characterized by an extensive plexus of <u>hemorrhoidal vessels</u>.  Abnormal dilation and varicosity of these vessels causes an inward bulging of the mucous membrane and a partial occlusion of the anal canal, resulting in internal hemorrhoids.</p>

<h3><u>#106 Appendix, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/106%20appendix.jpg" style="width:160px; height:150px; float:right;">Examine the components of the wall of this portion of the gastrointestinal tract and compare them with the small and large intestine. In the mucosa of the appendix there is extensive <span class="caps">GALT </span>that extends into the submucosa. Both diffuse and nodular lymphatic tissue are present.</p>
