						<p>In this connective tissue collagenous fibers predominate.</p>

<h3><u>#4 Skin, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></u></h3>

<p>Under the stratified squamous epithelium examined earlier is the dense irregular connective tissue of the <u>dermis</u>. Its thick collagenous (type I) bundles stain intensely with eosin and can be seen to course in various directions.</p>

<h3><u>#70 Breast, Inactive (H&amp;E)</u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/70%20breast.jpg" style="width:299px; height:120px; float:right;">Find the regions that contain ductal tissue at low power. Immediately surrounding these cells is a very small zone of pale-staining loose areolar connective tissue. Outside of this, there is a large zone of acidophilic dense irregularly arranged connective tissue. Clumps of white adipose tissue are scattered throughout the stroma of the mammary gland.</p>
