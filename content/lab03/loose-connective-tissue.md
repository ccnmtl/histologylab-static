						<p>This form of connective tissue has the largest number of cells per unit volume of extracellular matrix. The large number of cells frequently makes it difficult to distinguish the fibrous component without the use of special stains. </p>

<p>The fibers in the matrix have a loose and irregular arrangement, and they consist of collagenous, elastic, or reticular fibers. <u>Fibroblasts</u> and <u>macrophages</u> are the most common cells in loose connective tissue, but mast cells, plasma cells, neutrophils and fat cells may also be found.</p>

<p>Examine the scanned image at low power, and note that one surface is indented by pits that are lined by columnar epithelial cells. Immediately beneath these cells is the <u>loose connective tissue</u> called <u>lamina propria</u>.</p>
