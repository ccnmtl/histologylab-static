						<p>In this type of epithelium, no cells on the basal lamina reach the lumen. The layer of cells that rests on the basal lamina is the source of the upper layers of cells. </p>

<h3>Stratified squamous keratinized epithelium</h3>

<h3><u>#4 Skin, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></u></h3>

<p>The epithelium of the skin is known as the epidermis.  Its superficial layer is comprised of keratinized (cornified) squamous cells.  Note the multiple layers of the stratified squamous epithelial layer of the skin. As cells are displaced toward the skin surface their characteristics change. They ultimately die and are sloughed. This topmost keratinized layer stains dark pink and has no nuclei because the cells are dead.   </p>

<h3>Stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium</h3>

<h3><u>#33 Esophagus, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/33%20esophagus.jpg" style="width:103px; height:150px; float:right;">The stratified squamous epithelium lining the esophagus is non-keratinized in humans, but keratinized in some other species. Which part of the slide image corresponds to the esophageal lumen?</p>
