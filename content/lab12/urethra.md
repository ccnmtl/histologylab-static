						<h3><u><b>#55 Corpus spongiosum, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></b></u></h3>

<p>This tissue is readily identified at lowest magnification by the characteristic shape of the lumen of the penile urethra and by the surrounding sponge-like arrangement of <u>erectile tissue</u> filled with blood.  Study the epithelial lining of the penile urethra and observe that its appearance varies in different regions of the same section.  Most frequently it appears to be <u>pseudostratified</u> or <u>stratified columnar</u>.  Mucous glands may occur as nests of epithelial cells along the lining epithelium (intra-epithelial glands) or they may occur as more typical <u>urethral glands</u> (of Littre) whose ducts empty into local recesses of the urethral lumen.</p>

<p>The erectile tissue and the supporting fibro-muscular network of trabeculae that supports them are considered in the chapters on the male reproductive system.</p>
