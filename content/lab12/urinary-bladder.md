						<h3><u><b>#54 Bladder, (H&amp;E)</b></u></h3>

<p>Be certain that you can recognize transitional epithelium in both the relaxed and expanded states.  The basic structural arrangement of the bladder is similar to that of the ureter, and the structures and layers should be studied as in the previous slide.  Note the greatly thickened muscularis of the bladder. This slide shows the bladder in the relaxed state.</p>
