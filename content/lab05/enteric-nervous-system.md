						<p>The enteric nervous system is the intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract.  It is made up of ganglia and the nerves emanating from these neurons.  It contains glia like the central nervous system, however there are no Schwann cells, fibroblasts or other connective tissue elements within the ganglia.</p>

<h3><u>#39 Colon, (H&amp;E, thin plastic section)</u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/39%20colon%20%282%29.jpg" style="width:241px; height:140px; float:right;">At low power locate the pink (acidophilic) region of the smooth muscle.  The <u>myenteric plexus of Auerbach</u> is located between the two layers of smooth muscle.  Locate neuronal cell bodies within the ganglia.  What other types of cell would you expect to find in these ganglia?</p>
