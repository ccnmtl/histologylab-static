<h3><u>#83 Thoracic Sympathetic Ganglion, Human</u></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/83%20thoracic%20sympathetic%20ganglion.jpg" style="width:165px; height:150px; float:right;">A peripheral ganglion is a collection of neuronal cell bodies located outside of the <span class="caps">CNS. </span> In general, each cell body is encapsulated by <u>satellite cells</u>.  With medium power, identify the neuronal cell bodies and their eccentric nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Identify the encapsulating satellite cells.</p>

<p>Although no slide is suggested for study of a parasympathetic ganglion, these will be seen in many organs (e.g., tongue, pancreas, seminal vesicle).  As in sympathetic ganglia, the neurons in parasympathetic ganglia are surrounded by satellite cells.   </p>

<p>Preganglionic axons in both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are myelinated while postganglionics are unmyelinated.  What is the functional consequence of the location of parasympathetic  neurons near the target organ? </p>
