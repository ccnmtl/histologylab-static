						<h3><u><b>#55 Corpus Spongiosum, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></b></u></h3>

<p>The <u>corpora cavernosa</u> have been dissected away from the rest of the penis.  Examine the central <u>penile urethra</u> and the surrounding blood-filled vascular sinuses that comprise the erectile tissue of the <u>corpus spongiosum</u>.  Note that the lining epithelium of the penile urethra has a stratified columnar or stratified cuboidal appearance. Study the erectile tissue surrounding the urethra and observe that the trabeculae between blood sinuses contain smooth muscle and connective tissue fibers.  The connective tissue capsule surrounding the corpus spongiosum is not as thick as that surrounding the <u>corpora cavernosa</u>.</p>
