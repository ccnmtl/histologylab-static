						<h3>#67 Cervix, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/67%20cervix.jpg" style="width:217px; height:150px; float:right;">Distinguish the endocervix which is lined by typical cervical epithelium and containing glands, and the ectocervix, the portion of the cervix projecting into the vaginal lumen which is lined by a thickened, basophilic, stratified squamous epithelium. Locate at higher magnification some of the mucus-secreting epithelial cells, which line the cervical mucosa.  Note the pale-staining, supra-nuclear areas in these cells. Note also the abrupt transition between the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix and the stratified squamous epithelium of the ectocervix.  The bulk of the wall of the cervix is made up of bundles of smooth muscle interlaced with connective tissue.</p>

<p>What are some of the possible functions of cervical mucus? In what other regions of the body does one observe an abrupt junction between simple columnar and stratified epithelia?</p>
